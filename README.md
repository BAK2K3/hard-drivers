# Hard Drivers

This project is a static website for a ficticious Custom PC Building company, called Hard Drivers.  
It is developed primarily using HTML and CSS, with a small amount of javascript implemented for additional functionality.

---

## Project Concept

>**Hard Driver**  
hɑːd ˈdraɪvə | **Noun**  
*A CompTIA A+ certified computer magician, who has an abundance of love and pride for making your dream computer become a reality.*  

Hard Drivers is a customer budget based Custom PC Building company. Customers can obtain a “no obligation” free specification for a custom build PC based on a budget of their choosing. Customers can also choose to include additional service packages to their specification, and request additional peripherals (i.e Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, etc) to be paired perfectly with their brand new tailor-made computer.

# UX

## Strategy

### Stakeholder Interview

**What are some of your most important considerations when using a company to buy a custom build computer?**

_“I don’t want to have to keep adding parts to see the costs skyrocket, then have to start removing things I think I need or want, in order to keep it within a budget”._  

_“I want someone to recommend exactly what I need”._    

_“I want to be able to contact the company straight away”._    

### Competitor Review

[PC Specialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/ "Pc Specialist Homepage"): A huge amount of options from the outset, with quite significant price ranges. Onus is on the customer to know what they want/need.

[Box](https://www.box.co.uk/ "Box Homepage"): A less specific focus on builds, with immediate attention drawn to peripherals rather than computer.

[Chillblast](https://www.chillblast.com/ "Chillblast Homepage"): Not very user friendly, a lot of information, a lot of options, and high selling point is pre-build next day PCs.

### Project and Company Goals

**Psychological Factors**
* Envoke a positive emotional response from the branding of Hard Drivers.
  * Make the logo strong, bold, and stand out.
  * Make the logo unique, and aesthetically pleasing.
  * Use the logo consistently throughout the website.
  * Align the style and design of the pages to match the logo.
  * Minimalistic design approach, so as to not overwhelm the customer.
* Appeal to the customer by personalising the service.
  * Address the customer directly by repeatedly using the term _"You"_ and _"Your"_.
  * Make it clear that each customer is unique, and each computer will be build specifically for their needs.

**Pricing**

* Be transparent with cost.
    * The user decides the cost of the computer.
    * No hidden costs.
* Upsell as a separate entity.
    * Peripherals and Service packages are not included in initial budget.
    * The customer is not required to spend any more than their budget.

**Buyer Making Decision**

* Offer a _"No Obligation"_ quote/specification.
    * The customer will therefore not need to justify engaging with the company/website.
    * As such, they do not need to plan to engage with the company/website, other than stating a budget.
* Communicate that the hard work is taken away from the customer.
    * This suggests the user only needs to put in a small amount of effort to receive a full service in return.

**Product Considerations and Content Strategy**

* Minimalistic design, so at to draw attention, avoid overwhelming the customer, and encourage engagement.
    * The product is the _service_ provided by Hard Drivers, therefore strong colors, images, and headlines to engage with customer.
* Thin content where necessary, providing only the most important information from the outset.
    * Provide fuller content in sections of the website where the customer specifically wants further information.
* Every page has multiple "Enquire Now" buttons, so as to allow a user to immediately engage when they want to.
    * This "Enquire Now" should ultimately be a "Fast Track" service to allow a user to go from making the decision to enquire, to having made the enquiry, in as few interactions as possible.

**Packages Page: A Discussion on Informational Architecture**

As a Business, Hard Drivers would primarily make the most amount of profit from the additional services provided on top of the custom build computers. 
As such, an additional page was initially planned called _"Packages"_, which provided the customer with a detailed breakdown of the additional services 
they could purchase in conjunction with their new computer. This can be seen from the original wireframe designs.

After reviewing the original plans and wireframes, and after additional consideration, it was considered that this information in isolation appeared to be quite _'content thin'_,
and could potentially make having a separate page for this content feel empty and isolated. In addition to this, it would be entirely possible for a customer to visit the index page,
engage with the site immediately as intended, and forgo this page entirely.  Given this information is integral for the business, consideration needed to be made as to 
where this content could be added. Having this information appear on the _"Index"_ page would defer from its minimalistic design and intention, and could potentially feel like 
over-selling from a customer perspective, and considering the intention, context, and grouping of information on the _"About"_ page, it was decided that the _"packages"_ information would 
overload this page or side-track its intention.

From a business perspective, this information needed to be accessible and hard to miss. However, as a consumer, you would not want to be over-burdened with aggressive overselling. 
The positioning of this information needed to be relevant, compliment the flow and structure of the other pages, along with their features and content, and needed to fulfil its business purpose
of being a mandatory part of the selling process, without being intrusive. 

A work-around to this was explored, and has been considered for implementation, whereby the _"packages"_ page is removed entirely, and reference can be made in the _"About"_ page, under Cost, 
to additional services being provided. This reference will link to a modal whereby the content initially planned for the _"packages"_ page is displayed. In doing this, the services can be subtly referenced,
without being intrusive, and can provide the user with the additional information if they request it. Furthermore, in the _"Enquire"_ page, under the _"packages"_ section, the decision has been made
to ensure no package is preselected, and to provide a link to the same modal as previously referenced. In doing so, the user must engage with this aspect of the sales process, fulfilling the business need,
however is not obliged to delve into the additional information if they do not wish to do so, which would potentially fulfil the customer need of not being overwhelmed with information unnecessarily.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

### Additional Testing

### Known Bugs

**Validator errors:**

1. **W3 Jigsaw: CSS Validator shows errors with valid and responsive values**
    * -10px negative values are not allowed : 0 0 -10px rgb(228, 30, 30, 0.9), inset 0 0 0 rgba(228, 30, 30, 0.9)
    * Validator shows browster extensions as unknown (-moz, -webkit, etc)

2. **W3 HTML: **Error: The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element.**
    * When the 'glass-button' was initially implemented, it contained an anchor link so as to use the button as a link, however W3 HTML validator threw this error.
    * This was initially picked up when tabbing through the site, as it caused the buttons to be highlighed twice**
    * The glass-button and glass-buton a selector classes were eventually merged. 

**Development bugs:**

1. **Making image fully responsive and aesthetically logic for different viewports**
    * Started with absolute positioning of image in bottom right, but the image would sometimes overlap with content and required excessive viewport configurations.
    * Attempted finite height definition in px, however this was a similar outcome to the above, whereby it required consideration of "Min-height" as well as "Min-width" for viewports.
    * Attempted to add both the hero image and the "sales pitch" to a row, with Bootstrap col's, and to set the hero-image height in Viewport Height. However, this required the explicit definition of Div sizes, and image % size, which became combusersome and less fluid.
    * Set the pages "content" size to viewport-px (height of header+footer), then set all sections of the page to be in Flex format, with the appropriate layout definitions being amended on each viewport. This allowed fully dynamic image sizing, and div resizing, for the size of the page, regardless of device height/width.
    * This concept was then implemented into the about and enquire pages. 

2. **Clicking the modal button on the Enquire page attempted to submit the form, highlightiong incomplete fields on mobile, and triggering "this field needs completing".**
    * When initially implementing the Modal interface, a button was used to allow the user to bring up the packages modal. This issue was resolved by adding onclick="return false;" in button field. 
    * When adding the link to the package model in the about page, it was decided that a button was too obtrusive for the context of the layout, and therefore a customer hyperlink format was added. 
    * This also allowed the "Enquire" and "submit" button to maintain consistent, to achieve an aligned goal, without beleeding this feature onto other concepts. 

3. **When the content of the 'benefits' section of the table overflowed, the corresponding 'tick' boxes generated additional padding on the bottom of the cell, which conflicted with the 50% border concept implemented**
    * The issue arised from "vertical-align: center;", as this uses padding to align the contents. Due to the nature of the ::after 50% border, this caused the border to sit ontop of the padding, as opposed to the bottom of the cell as intended.
    * Solution: Set the td/th tags with position: relative;, and set the psuedo element to position: absolute;, then remove any padding from the psuedo element, and move that padding to the table element. 
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10077386/how-to-display-the-after-content-outside-element

4. **Tooltips were being displayed on top of the text in mobile view, despite having "data-placement: right".**
    * This was resolved by using "data-placement: left", even though it wasn't clear why.


5. **Issue with file locations from CSS when pushing to github pages**
    * When the site was published to github pages, the links to internal pages were not working, and the images were not being pulled from the assets folder.
    * The error was caused by the internal links being prefaced with "/". Once removed, the links worked appropriately.
    * The links to images in the CSS file were defined as: "/assets/images/...". Therefore, when using Gitpod, the links would work appropriately. 
    * Given how the page is hosted on github, the assets were being searched for in: "github.io/assets/images/..."
    * This was resolved by using a relative filepath, and removing the assets/ subdirectory, as such: "./images/...".

6. **Internet Explorer incompatability**
    * Flexbox

7. **Users informed me that on some mobile devices the Navbar disappears (akin to safari) after click on a form input or pressing submit**
    * On some mobile devices, clicking on an input form "zooms in" on the input field. Alternatively, submitting an incomplete form "zooms in" on the input form not complete.
    * This obfuscates the layout of the page (fixed header with embedded scrollable div), requiring users to zoom out to use the page correctly.
    * While this doesn't neccessarily break the layout of the page, it would require the user to zoom out in order to use the site correctly, creating a poor user experience.
    * This was fixed by adding: minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1 to the meta tag of the enquiry page.

**Other technical difficulties:**

1. **Github Commit Merge** 
    * On 27th October, I accidentally merged multiple git commits (df2b72005f9506c70c5d58fcb9964631462d7555/a8190a91b29cb1d4c3258e5d0f684390113bc646). While I researched how to undo the push, I was aware this would result in all of these changes being combined, and I wasn't fully comfortable 
    continuing with this as I didn't want to lose any more progress/commits. Accepted this single merge was an error, and moved on and learned from this.
