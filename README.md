# Hard Drivers

This project is a static website for a ficticious Custom PC Building company, called Hard Drivers.  
It is developed primarily using HTML and CSS, with a small amount of javascript implemented for additional functionality.

## Project Concept

>**Hard Driver**  
hɑːd ˈdraɪvə | **Noun**  
*A CompTIA A+ certified computer magician, who has an abundance of love and pride for making your dream computer become a reality.*  

Hard Drivers is a customer budget based Custom PC Building company. Customers can obtain a “no obligation” free specification for a custom build PC based on a budget of their choosing. Customers can also choose to include additional service packages to their specification, and request additional peripherals (i.e Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, etc) to be paired perfectly with their brand new tailor-made computer.

# UX

## Strategy

### Stakeholder Interview

**What are some of your most important considerations when using a company to buy a custom build computer?**

_“I don’t want to have to keep adding parts to see the costs skyrocket, then have to start removing things I think I need or want, in order to keep it within a budget”._  

_“I want someone to recommend exactly what I need”._    

_“I want to be able to contact the company straight away”._    

### Competitor Review

[PC Specialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/ "Pc Specialist Homepage"): A huge amount of options from the outset, with quite significant price ranges. Onus is on the customer to know what they want/need.

[Box](https://www.box.co.uk/ "Box Homepage"): A less specific focus on builds, with immediate attention drawn to peripherals rather than computer.

[Chillblast](https://www.chillblast.com/ "Chillblast Homepage"): Not very user friendly, a lot of information, a lot of options, and high selling point is pre-build next day PCs.

### Project and Company Goals

**Psychological Factors**
* Envoke a positive emotional response from the branding of Hard Drivers.
  * Make the logo strong, bold, and stand out.
  * Make the logo unique, and aesthetically pleasing.
  * Use the logo consistently throughout the website.
  * Align the style and design of the pages to match the logo.
  * Minimalistic design approach, so as to not overwhelm the customer.
* Appeal to the customer by personalising the service.
  * Address the customer directly by repeatedly using the term _"You"_ and _"Your"_.
  * Make it clear that each customer is unique, and each computer will be build specifically for their needs.

**Pricing**

* Be transparent with cost.
    * The user decides the cost of the computer.
    * No hidden costs.
* Upsell as a separate entity.
    * Peripherals and Service packages are not included in initial budget.
    * The customer is not required to spend any more than their budget.

**Buyer Making Decision**

* Offer a _"No Obligation"_ quote/specification.
    * The customer will therefore not need to justify engaging with the company/website.
    * As such, they do not need to plan to engage with the company/website, other than stating a budget.
* Communicate that the hard work is taken away from the customer.
    * This suggests the user only needs to put in a small amount of effort to receive a full service in return.

**Product Considerations and Content Strategy**

* Minimalistic design, so at to draw attention, avoid overwhelming the customer, and encourage engagement.
    * The product is the _service_ provided by Hard Drivers, therefore strong colors, images, and headlines to engage with customer.
* Thin content where necessary, providing only the most important information from the outset.
    * Provide fuller content in sections of the website where the customer specifically wants further information.
* Every page has multiple "Enquire Now" buttons, so as to allow a user to immediately engage when they want to.
    * This "Enquire Now" should ultimately be a "Fast Track" service to allow a user to go from making the decision to enquire, to having made the enquiry, in as few interactions as possible.
