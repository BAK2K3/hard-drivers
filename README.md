## Project Concept

>**Hard Driver**  
hɑːd ˈdraɪvə | **Noun**  
*A CompTIA A+ certified computer magician, who has an abundance of love and pride for making your dream computer become a reality.*  

Hard Drivers is a customer budget based Custom PC Building company. Customers can obtain a “no obligation” free specification for a custom build PC based on a budget of their choosing. Customers can also choose to include additional service packages to their specification, and request additional peripherals (i.e Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, etc) to be paired perfectly with their brand new tailor-made computer.

# UX

## Research and Preparation

### Stakeholder Interview

**What are some of your most important considerations when using a company to buy a custom build computer?**

_“I don’t want to have to keep adding parts to see the costs skyrocket, then have to start removing things I think I need or want, in order to keep it within a budget”._  

_“I want someone to recommend exactly what I need”._    

_“I want to be able to contact the company straight away”._    

### Competitor Review

[PC Specialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/ "Pc Specialist Homepage"): A huge amount of options from the outset, with quite significant price ranges. Onus is on the customer to know what they want/need.

[Box](https://www.box.co.uk/ "Box Homepage"): A less specific focus on builds, with immediate attention drawn to peripherals rather than computer.

[Chillblast](https://www.chillblast.com/ "Chillblast Homepage"): Not very user friendly, a lot of information, a lot of options, and high selling point is pre-build next day PCs.

### Project and Company Goals

**Psychological Factors**
* Evoke a positive emotional response from the branding of Hard Drivers.
  * Make the logo strong, bold, and stand out.
  * Make the logo unique, and aesthetically pleasing.
  * Use the logo consistently throughout the website.
  * Align the style and design of the pages to match the logo.
  * Minimalistic design approach, so as to not overwhelm the customer.
* Appeal to the customer by personalising the service.
  * Address the customer directly by repeatedly using the term _"You"_ and _"Your"_.
  * Make it clear that each customer is unique, and each computer will be build specifically for their needs.

**Pricing**

* Be transparent with cost.
    * The user decides the cost of the computer.
    * No hidden costs.
* Upsell as a separate entity.
    * Peripherals and Service packages are not included in initial budget.
    * The customer is not required to spend any more than their budget.

**Buyer Making Decision**

* Offer a _"No Obligation"_ quote/specification.
    * The customer will therefore not need to justify engaging with the company/website.
    * As such, they do not need to plan to engage with the company/website, other than stating a budget.
* Communicate that the hard work is taken away from the customer.
    * This suggests the user only needs to put in a small amount of effort to receive a full service in return.

**Product Considerations and Content Strategy**

* Minimalistic design, so at to draw attention, avoid overwhelming the customer, and encourage engagement.
    * The product is the _service_ provided by Hard Drivers, therefore strong colours, images, and headlines to engage with customer.
* Thin content where necessary, providing only the most important information from the outset.
    * Provide fuller content in sections of the website where the customer specifically wants further information.
* Every page has multiple "Enquire Now" buttons, so as to allow a user to immediately engage when they want to.
    * This "Enquire Now" should ultimately be a "Fast Track" service to allow a user to go from making the decision to enquire, to having made the enquiry, in as few interactions as possible.

**Packages Page: A Discussion on Informational Architecture**

As a Business, Hard Drivers would primarily make the most amount of profit from the additional services provided on top of the custom build computers. 
As such, an additional page was initially planned called _"Packages"_, which provided the customer with a detailed breakdown of the additional services 
they could purchase in conjunction with their new computer. This can be seen from the original wireframe designs.

After reviewing the original plans and wireframes, and after additional consideration, it was considered that this information in isolation appeared to be quite _'content thin'_,
and could potentially make having a separate page for this content feel empty and isolated. In addition to this, it would be entirely possible for a customer to visit the index page,
engage with the site immediately as intended, and forgo this page entirely.  Given this information is integral for the business, consideration needed to be made as to 
where this content could be added. Having this information appear on the _"Index"_ page would defer from its minimalistic design and intention, and could potentially feel like 
over-selling from a customer perspective, and considering the intention, context, and grouping of information on the _"About"_ page, it was decided that the _"packages"_ information would 
overload this page or side-track its intention.

From a business perspective, this information needed to be accessible and hard to miss. However, as a consumer, you would not want to be over-burdened with aggressive overselling. 
The positioning of this information needed to be relevant, compliment the flow and structure of the other pages, along with their features and content, and needed to fulfil its business purpose
of being a mandatory part of the selling process, without being intrusive. 

A work-around to this was explored, and has been considered for implementation, whereby the _"packages"_ page is removed entirely, and reference can be made in the _"About"_ page, under Cost, 
to additional services being provided. This reference will link to a modal whereby the content initially planned for the _"packages"_ page is displayed. In doing this, the services can be subtly referenced,
without being intrusive, and can provide the user with the additional information if they request it. Furthermore, in the _"Enquire"_ page, under the _"packages"_ section, the decision has been made
to ensure no package is preselected, and to provide a link to the same modal as previously referenced. In doing so, the user must engage with this aspect of the sales process, fulfilling the business need,
however is not obliged to delve into the additional information if they do not wish to do so, which would potentially fulfil the customer need of not being overwhelmed with information unnecessarily.

## Feature Implementation

### Site Wide

**Navbar**: Each page has a sticky/static navbar at the top of the page. This provides a consistent layout and structure as the user navigates through the site. The logo is always centred, and is always the most prominent header on each page. 
The navbar's background image is filtered through a radial top focused gradient, and is intended to provide a subtle yet effective "electrical" effect, with a colour scheme consistent with the rest of the site. On large devices, the navbar 
has a second row underneath the logo which displays the active page the user is on, with each link offering a mild yet stimulating visual effect when either the link is engaged with or hovered over. On mobile devices, the navigation links are hidden,
and activated with a "sandwich" (which is a server icon), which draw the links between the page logo and the current page's sub-heading. 

**Footer**: Each page has a static/sticky footer at the bottom of the page. This provides links to my Github, a second and more aestheticically stimulating link to the enquire page, and links to socials. The same background effect is used on the footer, but with the gradient
reversed, to provide an 'enclosed' look. Once again, this effect is subtle, yet effective. The Enquire button is designed to grab the user’s attention, with a continuous glowing effect. On mobile devices, the footer is consistent in style, with the only significant change being font size and positioning of the social links for a more user-friendly interface. 
On the "Enquire" page, as opposed to having a second "Enquire" button on the bottom, this button has been converted into a "Submit" button, which removes the redundancy of a recursive link, and implements a function which fits the contextual flow of the page.

**Viewport Control**: Where possible, the pages contain all information within the viewport on page load. Where this is not possible on very small mobile devices, or on the enquiry page, an intuitive navigation system has been implemented to allow for only the content
of the page (not the headings) to be scrollable. By presenting all information on the screen at once, due to having a minimalistic design, this should produce a powerful emotional response from the user, and would ensure that no information is missed.  

**Package Table**: The Package Table is available on the "About" page and "Enquire" page. It provides the user with a full breakdown of the different tiers of packages they can opt into when requesting a quote for their computer. The cost and benefits 
of these packages is explicitly clear, and a full screen-reader only accessibility description is available which explains which benefits are included in which package, and their associated costs. The colour design and structural layout of this form is representative to that of the rest of the site to maintain consistency. Each benefit contains a tooltip 
to provide additional information on each package benefit. The cost of each tier is made explicitly clear. On Modals, the tooltips are on the text of the benefits themselves, while on the Desktop "enquire" page, small icons sit at the end of each benefit that provide this tooltip.    

### Index.html
  
The index page has 3 subheadings at the top of the page which are centred. Each subheading is short, but combined conveys the ethos and business purpose of the website and company. Each subheading has a relevant icon to give users an emotional response to each subheading's content.
The colour combination of the headings is consistent with that of the main logo of the site. The lower half of the page offers a call to action, addressing the user, and incentivising no-risk engagement with the website, further emphasising the ethos and company intention.
The lower half also offers a vibrant, visually stimulating image of a laptop, which dynamically resizes to the size and dimensions of the page. The image relates to the context and content of the page. Viewing this page on a mobile device stacks the content in order of most importance from top to bottom.

### About.html

The About page offers further insight into the 3 selling points of the website/company. While maintaining the websites minimalistic design, each section offers a small amount of detail about each selling point, in the same informational order as displayed in the index page.
Each section contains a relevant image, which once again dynamically resizes depending on viewport. These images are not available on mobile devices; while they undoubtedly have a powerful combined effect on the page, it was decided that 
the explicit and succinct nature of the text means displaying all of this information on a single viewport on smaller devices was much more effective (as per the viewport control discussion above). For all viewports, the user can interact with a "Service Package" link which 
opens up a modal for the user, which displays the Package Table. 

### Enquire.html

The Enquire page allows a user to engage with the website and therefore the company, through filling in a simple form. It is therefore, ultimately, the most important page on the site. Each field is categorised and grouped into the relevant fieldset, with each individual field being clearly separated and labelled.
Out of 8 fields, 6 are required, and 2 are optional. The user must supply their name, email address, and phone number. They must then decide what type of computer they want, and their budget. The user can at this stage decide to opt in to be quoted for an optional peripheral to be paired with their computer. 
The user must then select a package tier, and then optionally provide more information regarding their requirements if they should wish to do so. 

Initially, a colour picker was implemented into the form, however this resulted in quite an arduous addition, and considering this aspect of the engagement is essentially just an initial consultation, this would have added nothing to the initial enquiry, and was therefore removed. 
It was also found on mobile devices that the colour picker was limited, and therefore could have easily caused frustration from the user, and was therefore removed. 

On large screens, the user is presented with the package table next to the enquiry form. On tablets and mobile devices, this package table is hidden, and users are presented with a link to view package details (in the same style as that on the about page) via a modal. 

In the footer of the enquiry page, the "enquiry" link has been replaced with a "submit" link. The formatting and style are the same as the enquire link to ensure consistency; it has been considered that this may obfuscate the user, and the intention of this particular button, as it may not be initially clear that the usage of the persistent button has changed, 
but the alternative to this was to retain a recursive "enquiry" link at the bottom of the enquiry page, and to and have a separate "submit" button at the bottom of the form. It was decided that the best solution to this was to replace the enquiry button with the submit button; this also works best for the mobile layout. 
Form submission is validated prior to submission, and users are alerted to any incomplete fields if necessary. On valid completion of the form, the user is presented with a thank you modal, informing them of the next steps, and the form is reset.

## Testing

### Automated Testing

1. **[W3 Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML Validation**
    * The project's HTML was validated using the automated W3 Markup Validator. 
    * The only error identified using this validator was the following: 
        * `Error: The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element`
    * When the 'glass-button' and 'button-glow' classes were initially implemented, they were designed to house an anchor tag, so as to use the button as a link.
    * An issue was identified prior to the validation, in that when tabbing through the site, it caused the buttons to be highlighted twice.
    * In order to resolve this issue, and to fix the validation error, the glass-button and glass-button>a selector classes were merged, and applied to anchor tags only.
    * This resulted in the same visual effect as intended, prevented the "double tabbing", and resolved the HTML Validation Error.

2. **[W3 Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - CSS Validation**
    * The project's CSS was validated using the automated W3 Jigsaw Validator.
    * The only error identified using this validator was the following:
        * `negative values are not allowed : 0 0 -10px rgb(228, 30, 30, 0.9), inset 0 0 0 rgba(228, 30, 30, 0.9);` 
    * Initially, when debugging this validation error, I identified that the CSS worked as intended, and responded to the negative values.
    * I tested similar code on the validator, found on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/):
        * `box-shadow:   inset -5px -5px 10px blue;`
    * This code did not throw any validation errors, therefore I determined this was a syntactical error, and amended the code as follows:
        * `0 0 -10px 0 rgb(228, 30, 30, 0.9), inset 0 0 0 rgba(228, 30, 30, 0.9)`
    * This produced an identical effect, and passed the validation.

3. **Bootstrap Linter**
    * Re-run and assess.

### Significant Bugs

**Development bugs:**

1. **Making image fully responsive and aesthetically logic for different viewports**
    * Started with absolute positioning of image in bottom right, but the image would sometimes overlap with content and required excessive viewport configurations.
    * Attempted finite height definition in px, however this was a similar outcome to the above, whereby it required consideration of "Min-height" as well as "Min-width" for viewports.
    * Attempted to add both the hero image and the "sales pitch" to a row, with Bootstrap col's, and to set the hero-image height in Viewport Height. However, this required the explicit definition of Div sizes, and image % size, which became cumbersome and less fluid.
    * Set the pages "content" size to viewport-px (height of header+footer), then set all sections of the page to be in Flex format, with the appropriate layout definitions being amended on each viewport. This allowed fully dynamic image sizing, and div resizing, for the size of the page, regardless of device height/width.
    * This concept was then implemented into the about and enquire pages. 

2. **Clicking the modal button on the Enquire page attempted to submit the form, highlighting incomplete fields on mobile, and triggering "this field needs completing".**
    * When initially implementing the Modal interface, a button was used to allow the user to bring up the packages modal. This issue was resolved by adding onclick="return false;" in button field. 
    * When adding the link to the package model in the about page, it was decided that a button was too obtrusive for the context of the layout, and therefore a customer hyperlink format was added. 
    * This also allowed the "Enquire" and "submit" button to maintain consistent, to achieve an aligned goal, without bleeding this feature onto other concepts. 

3. **When the content of the 'benefits' section of the table overflowed, the corresponding 'tick' boxes generated additional padding on the bottom of the cell, which conflicted with the 50% border concept implemented**
    * The issue came from "vertical-align: center;", as this uses padding to align the contents. Due to the nature of the ::after 50% border, this caused the border to sit on top of the padding, as opposed to the bottom of the cell as intended.
    * Solution: Set the td/th tags with position: relative;, and set the pseudo element to position: absolute;, then remove any padding from the pseudo element, and move that padding to the table element. 
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10077386/how-to-display-the-after-content-outside-element

4. **Tooltips were being displayed on top of the text in mobile view, despite having "data-placement: right".**
    * This was resolved by using "data-placement: left", even though it wasn't clear why.

5. **Issue with file locations from CSS when pushing to github pages**
    * When the site was published to github pages, the links to internal pages were not working, and the images were not being pulled from the assets folder.
    * The error was caused by the internal links being prefaced with "/". Once removed, the links worked appropriately.
    * The links to images in the CSS file were defined as: "/assets/images/...". Therefore, when using Gitpod, the links would work appropriately. 
    * Given how the page is hosted on github, the assets were being searched for in: "github.io/assets/images/..."
    * This was resolved by using a relative file path, and removing the assets/ subdirectory, as such: "./images/...".

6. **Internet Explorer incompatibility**
    * Flexbox

7. **Users informed me that on some mobile devices the Navbar disappears (akin to safari) after click on a form input or pressing submit**
    * On some mobile devices, clicking on an input form "zooms in" on the input field. Alternatively, submitting an incomplete form "zooms in" on the input form not complete.
    * This obfuscates the layout of the page (fixed header with embedded scrollable div), requiring users to zoom out to use the page correctly.
    * While this doesn't necessarily break the layout of the page, it would require the user to zoom out in order to use the site correctly, creating a poor user experience.
    * This was fixed by adding: minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1 to the meta tag of the enquiry page.

**Other technical difficulties:**

1. **Github Commit Merge** 
    * On 27th October, I accidentally merged multiple git commits (df2b72005f9506c70c5d58fcb9964631462d7555/a8190a91b29cb1d4c3258e5d0f684390113bc646). While I researched how to undo the push, I was aware this would result in all of these changes being combined, and I wasn't fully comfortable 
    continuing with this as I didn't want to lose any more progress/commits. Accepted this single merge was an error, and moved on and learned from this.
